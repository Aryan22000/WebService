Dear Tommi Lahti,

	I am writing to update you on our progress with Robot 82 project. 
In our group, we have assigned different responsibilities to our members for efficient progress. 

	Aryan Mohammadi has written the code to handle obstacles. 
When the robot encounters the first obstacle, it avoids it and continues following the black line. 
When it reaches the second obstacle, the robot moves back a little, plays music, and rotates around itself.

	Veronika Jedrna has written the code to make the robot follow the black line using the GetRedMode. 
This ensures that the robot stays on track and does not deviate from the black line.

Finally, Mohammadreza Dejamfard has developed the DataExchange code, which allows different classes to communicate with each other seamlessly.

We hope that our progress so far is satisfactory and that we can achieve our goals on time. 

list of our methods :
stomM = it stop the motors ,
rotateM = The robot rotates slightly to the right in its place for 1.5 seconds,
rotateMo = The robot rotates slightly to the right in its place for 0.8 seconds,
runM = The robot move forward in its place for 6 seconds,
ending = The ending of the robot when it see the obstacle , It rotate for 4 seconds,
ScStop = Stop the robot for 10 seconds,
Back = The robot go back in its place for 1 second,
Best regards,
"team16"
